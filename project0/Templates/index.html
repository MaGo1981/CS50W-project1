      <h1>Marko G</h1>
      <p>I lived in Zabok.</p>
      <p>I moved to Zagreb where I now live.</p>
      <p>I love swimming and swim weekly for miles.</p>
      <p>I like basketball and I used to play with my buddies</a>.</p>
      <p>I do not anymore, but it's still cool.</p>
      <p>I have a beautiful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYVthMoQI6x4N3yoseSdQuw" target="_blank">wife</a>, we got <a href="MrsGoluban.html" target="_blank">married</a> recently.</p>
      <p>I enjoy nature with my wife, from mountains to the sea and we can play badminton whole day long.
      <p>I write <a href="https://github.com/MaGo1981" target="_blank">code</a> and it gets me into flow. It is one of my passions!</p>
      <p>I aspire to turn profesional as a developer.</p>
      <p>I am working in sales with some awesome people right now.</p>
      <p>I have a more detailed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marko-g-443012121/">resume</a> if you're into that sort of thing.</p>
